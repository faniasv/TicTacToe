---

> ## Background
>
> Hello World! I have created a Tic-Tac-Toe game for the final project, which generally allows two players to play against each other on a virtual game board. The **core** of this project is its **object-oriented design**
>
> **If you find this project helpful, please consider giving it a STAR ^, which will be the biggest encouragement to me!**

## General workflow of the game

1. Demonstrate welcome messages and choose to play with human/computer.
2. Create name for Player1 and Player2 if you choose to play with human. The player name for computer will be assigned directly as 'Computer'.
2. Display the initial empty game board.
3. Randomly select one user to begin, and prompt them to enter their moves in alternate turns.
4. Maintain the game board and display the updated board after each move.
5. Check for winners or stalemate of the game in real time, and declare the result once a certain round reaches its finale.
